    # The "Build with Gradle" step does a build using the gradle/gradle-build-action 
    # action provided by the Gradle organization on GitHub. The action takes care of 
    # invoking Gradle, collecting results, and caching state between jobs. 
    # For more information, See: https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action.      
    - name: Build with Gradle
      run: ./gradle build
    # List the Build output folder to confirm JAR file was built
    - name: Build Result
      run: ls build/libs

    # Gradle will usually create output files like JARs, EARs, or WARs in the build/libs directory. 
    # You can upload the contents of that directory using the upload-artifact action.
